Overestimation will generate unnecessary data and underestimation increases the risk that the digital health system will not achieve its health outcomes. If any of the data you plan to collect is already being collected, or will be collected via another planned digital health initiative, find out whether you could access it, rather than collecting it again from scratch. Sharing data avoids unnecessary energy expenditure in storing duplicate data. It also avoids the unnecessary effort, and likely data collection fatigue, in collecting the same data twice. Be aware that even when data is only collected once, data providers may find the exercise burdensome and data collectors may even resort to outsourcing the data collection. Both of these can contribute to poor data quality. To incentivise people to provide and collect good quality data it is advisable to ensure that there are tangible benefits for each local community involved."

An example would be collecting data on employment or marital status when the digital health service being planned has no use for this.

Use the following techniques to achieve this: Data Governance: Find the relevant regulation for how long data generated by the Digital Health service needs to be stored, and establish processes to ensure unnecessary data is deleted Data Management: Organization of data into distinct categories makes it easy to find and gives an accurate and complete view. Data Sharing Strategy: this can prevent data redundancy. Tiered Data Storage: Store your data in a way that reflects how regularly it is used and the speed with which it needs to be accessible. Cold storage has a lower energy cost and can be used for archived data."

Spatial shifting means allowing your processing to run at a data centre in a different location when the energy supply to the primary data centre is low in renewables. Clearly the degree to which you can fine-tune a Digital Health system may be limited â€“ data processing to provide monitoring, for example, may need to be happening constantly. But there may be considerable flexibility around other processing, such as reporting and data maintenance tasks."
